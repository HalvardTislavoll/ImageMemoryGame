tkinter variable class' trace() method is deprecated since Python 3.6, new trace_add() method should be used:

    trace('w', method) has become trace_add('write', method)
    trace('r', method) has become trace_add('read', method)


For trace_add the following is stated:

    trace_add(self, mode, callback)

    Define a trace callback for the variable.

    Mode is one of "read", "write", "unset", or a list or tuple of such strings. Callback must be a function which is called when the variable is read, written or unset.

    Return the name of the callback.


So, judging from that, 'wu' should now be ['write', 'unset']
